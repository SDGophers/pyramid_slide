Pyramid Slide challenge (https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6vi9ro/170823_challenge_328_intermediate_pyramid_sliding/?st=j8oziieq&amp;sh=700700bb)

## example 1

``` bash
go test
```

*Note: the brute force approach breaks after the pyramid has 64 rows as it uses an int to keep track of which path to take*
